When done, you can exit with:
deactivate

To come back later, just activate again:
source venv/bin/activate

-->git status
When to use:
Before anything
To see what changed and what’s staged
👉 “What’s going on in my project right now?”

-->git add .
When to use:
After you’ve made changes you want to save
👉 “I’m happy with all my current changes.”
You can also do:
git add filename.py
if you only want to add one file.

-->git commit -m "message"
When to use:
After git add
When you reach a logical checkpoint
👉 “Save a snapshot of my work.”
Good commit messages (important):
cleaned data and handled missing values
added EDA plots for population growth
initial project structure
❌ Bad:
update
stuff
final_final_v2

-->git push
When to use:
After committing
To upload your work to GitHub
👉 “Send my saved work to GitHub.”
🧠 Typical daily flow
git status
git add .
git commit -m "meaningful message"
git push

2️⃣ Slightly Less Frequent (but important)
-->git pull
When to use:
At the start of the day
Before you start coding
When working with others
👉 “Get the latest changes from GitHub.”
⚠️ VERY important when collaborating.

-->git log
When to use:
To see past commits
To understand what changed and when

-->git diff
When to use:
To see exactly what changed in a file
Great before committing.
